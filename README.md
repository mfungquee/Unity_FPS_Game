# Unity_FPS_Game
This is a 3D First Person Shooter game created for my Game Development class at Hofstra. It makes use of assets from the unity asset store and scripts written in Javascript.

There is an additional .resS file that was "too large" for git lfs to handle but it isn't necessary to run the game. This file should go in the FPS_Survival_Data directory.
Here is the link to the sharedassets0.assets.resS file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6fkSdCPCsMsVzNRbnpmdkpfWUk/view?usp=sharing
